/*
 * The sessions view of the manager window: each profile's Claude Code
 * sessions. On the left the profiles, with their badge and how many sessions
 * they list; in the middle the chosen profile's sessions as a tree, the
 * starred ones first, then by project (every row drawn here), or why it has
 * none; on the right the selected session: where it lives, then each
 * profile with what is going on there and an Actions box (open, rename,
 * star, remove, keep when its removal waits, or share and copy where it is
 * not listed), what is not listed, and Delete everywhere at the bottom. The
 * tree's context menu holds the entry's actions in the profile shown,
 * opening, sharing and copying in the others, the folder and Delete
 * everywhere; the other profiles' entries change from their Actions box.
 * Several sessions are chosen together with Ctrl and Shift (click, or Shift
 * and the arrows) or Ctrl+A, and a folder's row or Starred stands for its
 * sessions: their menu shares, copies (syncui.c), exports, stars, removes or
 * deletes them all.
 * What they do is in sessionedit.c; colors, fonts, rows, buttons and boxes
 * come from theme.c, as everywhere.
 *
 * It follows the disk without polling: a thread waits for folder
 * notifications on each profile's session entries and config.json and on
 * the transcripts folder (while one of them is missing, on its nearest
 * existing parent, for the next folder down) and posts WM_APP_SESSIONS to the
 * window, once for a burst of them. Another thread reads the snapshot and
 * posts WM_APP_SESSIONS_READY; a notification during a read reads again a
 * moment after that read is published. A snapshot that changes nothing the
 * tree shows leaves the tree alone (no flicker, no scroll); one that does
 * keeps the selection, the folded folders and the row on top of the view in
 * its place.
